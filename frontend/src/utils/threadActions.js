// Which messages a thread-wide action should actually operate on.
//
// A thread row stands for several messages, so acting on one means resolving the rest. The
// obvious place to get them is the cache populated when the thread was last expanded, and that
// is the trap: the cache is a snapshot, and a thread gains messages while you are looking at it.
//
// The observed failure: a GitHub thread received a reply after the thread was opened. Marking it
// read sent the bulk-read call for the CACHED ids, so the newer message was never included and
// stayed unread on the server. The UI then marked the cached copies read, so the row rendered as
// read with the unread message hidden inside it. The account badge showed 1 unread that could
// not be cleared by any amount of clicking, because the message was unreachable.
//
// The same staleness is worse for the destructive paths. A thread-wide delete or move built from
// a stale list silently leaves the newest messages behind, which is the bug the bulk-delete
// comment in MessageList already describes having fixed once.
//
// So the cache renders; the server decides what to act on. `allowCache` has to be asked for
// explicitly, and nothing currently asks, which is the point: a future caller has to think about
// staleness rather than inherit it by default.
//
// The thread also spans accounts. One email delivered to two of the reader's accounts is two
// mailbox items, and the thread route returns both so the conversation can show them (#476),
// while the bulk endpoints check only the user. Outside the unified inbox a row stands for its
// own account's copies, so an action on it takes only those. `accountId` is the account whose
// copies an action takes, and null takes every copy, as a unified-inbox row counts every
// unified account's.

// remove optimistically so the list responds immediately, hold the real request for the
// length of the undo window, and put everything back if the user undoes it or the
// request fails. Acting on a conversation only changes how many messages move together,
// which is why it is one runner and a few thin callers.
//
// The optimistic removal uses the messages the pane is showing, because that is what the
// reader can see. The request does not: at commit time it re-resolves the thread from the
// server, for the staleness reason documented at the top of this file. A reply that landed
// while the conversation was open must be archived along with the rest of it, not left
// behind to resurrect the thread.
//
// Each returns whether it took anything, since a filter can leave nothing to act on (Spam spares
// the reader's own mail, Snooze takes only an inbox copy) and the pane closes only on success.
